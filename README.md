# cs-python-project-treasureWorld
TREASURE WORLD!! A repo for a CS Programming project in Python.


The **Treasure world** project requires you to write an ASCII text based python program that will allow a player to play a game

In this game the player plays in a 2D grid world that is filled with
- Mainly nothing
- Gold!! :)
- Sharks :(
- And... Uranium ?!?!

The player can navigate around the world, trying to find the gold but avoid the sharks. When they find the uranium they are 3 rounds of omniscience (all knowing - so the player can “see” where the treasure and the sharks are - but not any more uranium)
