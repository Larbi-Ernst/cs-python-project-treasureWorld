    "1)\tThe program should randomly generate worlds (gold, sharks and uranium) randomly, but there should be more “nothing” than G,S,U.\n",

    "2)\tThe player should see the world (where they are, where the \"grid\" is?) but not the detail (not where sharks or gold or uranium is - more about this below)\n",
